## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This is not a hack.  
This is not malware.  
This is a proof-of-concept for **abusing the trust model** behind NFC contactless payments â€” using only whatâ€™s already allowed.

---

## ðŸš¨ TL;DR

- You can **initiate an offline NFC payment**,  
- **Delay or transfer** that authorization elsewhere,  
- And **complete the transaction later**, when the cardholder is long gone.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This PoC is meant to provoke **thought, discussion, and awareness**.  
It does not exploit vulnerabilities â€” it **challenges assumptions** about time, trust, and authorization locality.
